This will start off as just an HTML and CSS page. Over time it may grow and grow.... 

First of all, make sure you have Git installed on your computer.

The next step is to type in the command line (or use the GUI based tools that are included in the Mac and Windows Github software)

git clone git@github.com:bryantt23/odin-project-beginnings.git

Next change into the directory in the command line.

Create a branch based on what you want to do, i.e.  git checkout -b "modify index file"

Make sure you are on the branch by typing in "git status"

Make your changes then run "git status" in the command line to remind yourself of what you did

If everything works, commit the changes by typing in the command line 
"git add ."
This adds all of the files you modified

Next type in the command line, "git commit -am "updated index file by adding paragraphs"
Or type in "" whatever specific changes you made

To switch to the master branch type in the command line "git checkout master"

To merge the branch you committed, type in the command line "git merge modify index file"
or whatever the branch name was

Finally to push the change, type in the command line "git push -u origin master"

Feel free to modify, correct, or add to my explanation :)
